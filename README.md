#Ratings

1.Home page

In this page we can see the different types of movies with their rating and Story line. In the rating column I have added rating display and button to give rating to a particular movie.

2.Rating Page

If the person clicks the button to give rating to a particular movie he will immediately redirected to the rating page of particular movie and there the person can give rating between 1-5.

3.MYSQL Database

After giving the rating it will immediately save in the MYSQL Database. Every rating will be individually saved in the corresponding movie table in database.
